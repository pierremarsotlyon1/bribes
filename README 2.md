# Basic Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```

run a fork => npx hardhat node --fork https://eth-mainnet.alchemyapi.io/v2/C9kzXL-6HwtqvidRZrFS51UX-XC_Nxho
run test with a fork => npx hardhat test --network localhost
